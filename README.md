## Rules of the Games

1. The runs scored in the game is decided by the dice
2. The team who will bat first is decided by the toss. 
3. During toss which is completely random, whichever team is selected they are will always bat first.
4. During batting the number on the roll of the dice decides the run made by the batting team, all numbers which adds runs to batting team are 1,2,3,4,6
5. Whenever 5 comes on the dice the current batsman on the strike is out and another one comes to bat
6. The batsman on strike is decided by odd and even like if a batsman is out on odd then next batsman will come on odd number.
7. After all 10 wickets are gone the next team chases the score down.
